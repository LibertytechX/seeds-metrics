## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Implementation
- Action handlers use alerts/confirms (placeholders for real modals)
- Audit status changes update local state only (no backend persistence)
- Team members list is hardcoded (ready for backend integration)
- Portfolio export generates placeholder CSV (needs real loan data)

### Future Enhancements
- Replace alerts with proper modals
- Integrate with backend API for persistence
- Fetch team members from backend
- Implement real portfolio export with loan details
- Add loading states for async operations
