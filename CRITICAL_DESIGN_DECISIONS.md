# Critical Design Decisions

## üéØ Overview

This document highlights the most important architectural decisions made for the Metrics Dashboard Backend. These decisions have significant implications for implementation and must be understood by all team members.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DECISION #1: Computed Fields from Repayments

### **The Decision**

**All derived loan fields are computed from repayments data, NOT sent from the main business backend.**

### **What This Means**

The `loans` table has **two types of fields**:

#### **Type 1: FROM ETL SOURCE (20 fields)**
These come directly from the main backend:
- Loan identifiers (loan_id, customer_id, officer_id)
- Loan details (loan_amount, disbursement_date, maturity_date, interest_rate, fee_amount)
- Geographic info (region, branch, state)
- Channel info (channel, channel_partner)
- Status (status, closed_date)

#### **Type 2: [COMPUTED] (14 fields)**
These are calculated by the analytics service from repayments:
- **DPD tracking**: `current_dpd`, `max_dpd_ever`
- **First payment**: `first_payment_missed`, `first_payment_due_date`, `first_payment_received_date`
- **Outstanding balances**: `principal_outstanding`, `interest_outstanding`, `fees_outstanding`, `total_outstanding`
- **Collections**: `total_principal_paid`, `total_interest_paid`, `total_fees_paid`
- **Risk indicators**: `fimr_tagged`, `early_indicator_tagged`

### **Why This Decision?**

‚úÖ **Reduces load on main business server** - No complex aggregations needed  
‚úÖ **Centralized calculation logic** - All metrics in one place  
‚úÖ **Real-time updates** - Triggers automatically update fields  
‚úÖ **Audit trail** - Raw data preserved for recalculation  
‚úÖ **Performance** - Computed fields stored and indexed  

### **How It Works**

```
Main Backend sends:
  - loan_id: "LN001"
  - loan_amount: 500000
  - disbursement_date: "2024-01-15"
  - ... (17 more ETL fields)
  - [NO DPD, NO outstanding, NO totals]

‚Üì ETL inserts into loans table

Main Backend sends repayments:
  - repayment_id: "REP001"
  - loan_id: "LN001"
  - principal_paid: 80000
  - interest_paid: 15000
  - fees_paid: 5000

‚Üì ETL inserts into repayments table

‚Üì Trigger fires automatically

Loans table updated:
  - total_principal_paid: 80000
  - principal_outstanding: 420000
  - total_outstanding: 445000
  - current_dpd: 0
  - fimr_tagged: FALSE
  - ... (9 more computed fields)
```

### **Implementation**

**Database Trigger:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trg_update_loan_after_repayment
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON repayments
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_loan_computed_fields();
```

**See:** `ETL_DATA_FLOW_SPECIFICATION.md` for complete details.

## üèóÔ∏è DECISION #2: Separate Microservice Architecture

### **The Decision**

**Build analytics as a separate microservice, not part of the main backend.**

### **Architecture**

```
Main Business Backend (Transactional)
    ‚Üì (Event Stream / ETL)
Analytics Microservice (Read-Only)
    ‚Üì (REST API)
Metrics Dashboard (Frontend)
```

### **Why This Decision?**

‚úÖ **Performance isolation** - Heavy analytics won't slow down core business  
‚úÖ **Independent scaling** - Scale analytics separately from main backend  
‚úÖ **Technology flexibility** - Use Go for analytics, Node.js for main backend  
‚úÖ **Deployment independence** - Deploy analytics without touching main backend  

### **Trade-offs**

‚ùå **Additional infrastructure** - Need separate servers/containers  
‚ùå **Data synchronization** - Need ETL process (15-30 min delay)  
‚ùå **Complexity** - Two codebases to maintain  

**Verdict:** Benefits outweigh costs for this use case.

---

## üîß DECISION #3: Technology Stack - Go (Golang)

### **The Decision**

**Use Go (Golang) as the primary language for the analytics backend.**

### **Why Go?**

‚úÖ **10-100x faster** than Node.js for CPU-intensive calculations  
‚úÖ **Built-in concurrency** - Goroutines for parallel metric calculations  
‚úÖ **Low memory footprint** - Efficient for large datasets  
‚úÖ **Single binary deployment** - Easy to deploy  
‚úÖ **Excellent PostgreSQL support** - `pgx` driver is production-ready  

### **Alternative: Node.js (TypeScript)**

**When to use Node.js instead:**
- Rapid prototyping needed
- Team already knows JavaScript/TypeScript
- Dataset is small (< 100K loans)
- Time-to-market is critical

### **Comparison**

| Aspect | Go | Node.js |
|--------|----|----|
| **Performance** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Concurrency** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (goroutines) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (async/await) |
| **Development Speed** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Team Familiarity** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Ecosystem** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Memory Usage** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |

**Recommendation:** Go for production, Node.js for prototyping.

## üìä DECISION #4: Pre-Aggregation Strategy

### **The Decision**

**Pre-calculate and store officer/branch metrics, compute drilldowns on-demand.**

### **What Gets Pre-Aggregated?**

**Stored in Database:**
- `officer_metrics_daily` - All officer metrics (FIMR, AYR, DQI, Risk Score, etc.)
- `branch_metrics_daily` - All branch metrics
- **Frequency:** Every 15-30 minutes

**Computed On-Demand:**
- Loan-level drilldowns (FIMR drilldown, Early Indicators drilldown)
- Filtered queries (by date range, region, branch, officer)
- **Frequency:** When user requests

### **Why This Decision?**

‚úÖ **Fast API responses** - Pre-aggregated data returns in < 200ms  
‚úÖ **Reduced database load** - Don't recalculate metrics on every request  
‚úÖ **Flexible drilldowns** - Users can filter loan-level data dynamically  
‚úÖ **Historical tracking** - Daily snapshots for trend analysis  

### **Trade-offs**

‚ùå **Storage overhead** - Need tables for daily metrics  
‚ùå **Data freshness** - 15-30 minute delay  
‚ùå **Complexity** - Need background workers  

**Verdict:** Essential for performance at scale.

## üíæ DECISION #5: Caching Strategy

### **The Decision**

**Use Redis with 15-minute TTL for frequently accessed metrics.**

### **What Gets Cached?**

- Officer metrics (all fields)
- Branch metrics (all fields)
- Filter options (regions, branches, officers)

### **What Doesn't Get Cached?**

- Loan-level drilldowns (too many combinations)
- Real-time audit updates

### **Cache Invalidation**

**Time-based:**
- TTL: 15 minutes (aligned with batch processing)

**Event-based:**
- Invalidate officer cache when audit status changes
- Invalidate branch cache when officer reassigned

### **Why This Decision?**

‚úÖ **Sub-millisecond responses** - Redis is extremely fast  
‚úÖ **Reduced database load** - 80%+ cache hit rate target  
‚úÖ **Simple invalidation** - TTL handles most cases  

---

## üîÑ DECISION #6: Data Synchronization - Hybrid Approach

### **The Decision**

**Use batch processing (primary) + event-driven updates (secondary).**

### **Batch Processing (Every 15-30 minutes)**

**What:**
- Sync all loans, repayments, schedules from main backend
- Calculate all officer/branch metrics
- Update cache

**Why:**
- Reliable and predictable
- Handles bulk updates efficiently
- Simple to implement

### **Event-Driven (Real-time)**

**What:**
- Critical events only (loan disbursed, loan closed, audit status changed)
- Trigger immediate cache invalidation
- Optional: Trigger immediate recalculation

**Why:**
- Faster updates for critical events
- Better user experience
- Complements batch processing

### **On-Demand (User-triggered)**

**What:**
- Loan-level drilldowns with filters
- Calculated when user requests

**Why:**
- Too many combinations to pre-calculate
- Users need flexible filtering

## üóÑÔ∏è DECISION #7: Database Design - Supporting Tables

### **The Decision**

**Create supporting tables for accurate metric calculations.**

### **Supporting Tables**

1. **`loan_schedule`** - Required for D0-6 Slippage calculation
2. **`dpd_transitions`** - Required for Roll calculation
3. **`par15_snapshots`** - Required for AYR calculation (mid-month PAR15)

### **Why These Tables?**

**Without `loan_schedule`:**
- Can't calculate `amount_due_7d` (needed for D0-6 Slippage)
- Can't track which installments are overdue

**Without `dpd_transitions`:**
- Can't calculate Roll (movement from DPD 1-6 to 7-30)
- Can't track DPD bucket changes over time

**Without `par15_snapshots`:**
- Can't calculate AYR (needs PAR15 at mid-month, not current)
- Can't track historical PAR15 trends

### **Trade-offs**

‚ùå **More tables to maintain** - 12 total instead of 4  
‚ùå **More ETL complexity** - Need to sync schedules  
‚ùå **More storage** - Especially `loan_schedule` (10M-100M rows)  

**Verdict:** Essential for accurate metric calculations.

## üìà DECISION #8: Performance Targets

### **The Targets**

| Metric | Target | Strategy |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **API Response (p95)** | < 200ms | Pre-aggregation + Redis |
| **Drilldown (p95)** | < 1s | Optimized indexes |
| **Cache Hit Rate** | > 80% | 15-min TTL |
| **Calculation Time** | < 5 min | Parallel processing |
| **Data Freshness** | < 30 min | Batch every 15-30 min |
| **Concurrent Users** | 100+ | Horizontal scaling |

### **Why These Targets?**

- **< 200ms API**: Industry standard for good UX
- **< 1s drilldown**: Acceptable for filtered queries
- **> 80% cache hit**: Reduces database load significantly
- **< 5 min calculation**: Ensures timely updates
- **< 30 min freshness**: Balances freshness with system load
- **100+ users**: Expected dashboard usage

## üîí DECISION #9: Security Model

### **The Decision**

**JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC).**

### **Roles**

1. **Admin** - Full access (read + write)
2. **Auditor** - Read + audit management
3. **Viewer** - Read-only

### **Why This Decision?**

‚úÖ **Stateless** - No session storage needed  
‚úÖ **Scalable** - Works with multiple API instances  
‚úÖ **Standard** - Industry best practice
