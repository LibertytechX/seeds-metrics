-- Migration: Update current_dpd calculation in loan metrics trigger
-- This migration updates the update_loan_computed_fields() function to:
-- 1. Calculate current_dpd from loan_schedule if available (existing logic)
-- 2. If loan_schedule is empty, calculate DPD based on:
--    - Days since last repayment (if > 30 days and outstanding > 0, loan is overdue)
--    - Days since disbursement (if no repayments and > 30 days, loan is overdue)
-- 3. Ensure current_dpd is always calculated, not just when loan_schedule exists
