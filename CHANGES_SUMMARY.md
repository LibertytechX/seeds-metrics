## 📊 Change 1: AYR Formula Update

### What Changed
Updated the AYR (Adjusted Yield Ratio) calculation from a normalized form to a direct revenue-to-PAR15 ratio.

### Old Formula (REMOVED)
```
AYR = (interestCollected + feesCollected) / (1 + overdue15dRatio)
where overdue15dRatio = overdue15d / totalPortfolio
```

### New Formula (IMPLEMENTED)
```
AYR = (Interest + Fees realized-to-date in month) ÷ (PAR15 exposure at half month)
```

### Files Modified
1. **src/utils/metrics.js** - Updated `calculateAYR` function
2. **src/utils/metricInfo.js** - Updated tooltip description
3. **src/utils/mockData.js** - Added `par15MidMonth` field, updated function call
4. **src/utils/metrics.test.js** - Updated test cases

### Impact
- More direct measurement of revenue efficiency
- Better alignment with business requirements
- Clearer interpretation for users
- Band thresholds remain unchanged (Green ≥0.50, Watch 0.30-0.49, Flag <0.30)

### Example Calculation
```
Officer: John Doe
Interest Collected: ₦2,100,000
Fees Collected: ₦450,000
PAR15 Mid-Month: ₦4,500,000

AYR = (2,100,000 + 450,000) / 4,500,000 = 0.567 (Green)
```
